Democracy Guided by the Inner Wisdom in the Deliberations of Representatives: This principle advocates for a democratic system where representatives are chosen through fair elections and engage in deliberative processes. It highlights the value of consensus and collective decision-making, ensuring that the voices of the populace are heard and considered.
Social Justice for All Indonesian People: This tenet seeks to ensure equitable distribution of resources and opportunities among all citizens, aiming to reduce social inequalities and promote the welfare of every individual in society.
3. State Governance
