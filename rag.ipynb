In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective Continual Image Segmentation method\\nwith incremental Dynamic Query (CISDQ), which decouples the representation learning of both old and new knowledge\\nwith lightweight query embedding. CISDQ mainly includes three contributions: 1) We define dynamic queries with adaptive back\\x02ground class to exploit past knowledge and learn future classes\\nnaturally. 2) CISDQ proposes a class/instance-aware Query Guided Knowledge Distillation strategy to overcome catastrophic\\nforgetting by capturing the inter-class diversity and intra-class identity. 3) Apart from semantic segmentation, CISDQ intro\\x02duce the continual learning for instance segmentation in which\\ninstance-wise labeling and supervision are considered. Extensive\\nexperiments on three datasets for two tasks (i.e., continual\\nsemantic and instance segmentation are conducted to demon\\x02strate that CISDQ achieves the state-of-the-art performance,\\nspecifically, obtaining 4.4% and 2.9% mIoU improvements for\\nthe ADE 100-10 (6 steps) setting and ADE 100-5 (11 steps) setting'),\n",
